# Time Complexity:
# The time complexity of BFS in this case is O(V + E), where:
# ùëâ
# V is the number of vertices (nodes, or people in this case).

# ùê∏
# E is the number of edges (connections between people).

# Explanation:

# Each node is dequeued and processed exactly once.
# For each node, we look at its adjacent nodes (its neighbors), and that is done once per edge.
# Thus, the total time complexity is proportional to the sum of the vertices and the edges in the graph, i.e., O(V + E).

# Space Complexity:
# The space complexity is also O(V + E) because:
# We store all vertices and edges in the graph.
# The BFS queue can hold at most all vertices in the worst case.
# The searched set can also hold up to
# ùëâ
# V people.
# Thus, both the queue and the searched set will take O(V) space, and storing the graph requires O(V + E). Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(V + E).
